/**
 * This interface tells PowerMock to prepare certain classes for testing. Classes needed to be defined using this interface are typically those that needs to be byte-code manipulated. This includes final classes, classes with final, private, static or native methods that should be mocked and also
 * classes that should be return a mock object upon instantiation.
 * <p>
 * This interface can be placed at both test classes and individual test methods. If placed on a class all test methods in this test class will be handled by PowerMock (to allow for testability). To override this behavior for a single method just place a <code>&#064;PrepareForTest</code> interface
 * on the specific test method. This is useful in situations where for example you'd like to modify class X in test method A but in test method B you want X to be left intact. In situations like this you place a <code>&#064;PrepareForTest</code> on method B and exclude class X from the
 * {@link #value()} list.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you need to prepare inner classes for testing, this can be done by suppling the fully-qualified name of the inner-class that should be mocked to the {@link #fullyQualifiedNames()} list.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The interface should always be combined with the <code>&#064;RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)</code> if using junit 4.x or
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static TestSuite suite() throws Exception {
 * 	return new PowerMockSuite(MyTestCase.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * if using junit3.
 * <p>
 * The difference between this interface and the {@link PrepareForTest} interface is that this interface only modifies the specified classes whereas the {@link PrepareForTest} interface manipulates the full class hierarchy. This interface is recommend if you want full control over which classes that
 * are byte-code manipulated.
